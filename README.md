# Human-Pose-Estimation
This repository contains code and models for human pose estimation, a computer vision task that involves predicting the positions of human joints (keypoints) in images or videos. The project leverages deep learning techniques to accurately detect and localize keypoints such as shoulders, elbows, knees, and ankles.

## Features

- **Pre-trained Models:** Access to state-of-the-art models pre-trained on large datasets.
- **Inference Pipeline:** Easy-to-use scripts for running pose estimation on new images and videos.
- **Training Scripts:** Tools and scripts for training your own pose estimation models from scratch.
- **Visualization:** Utilities for visualizing key points and skeletons on images and videos.
- **Benchmarking:** Performance evaluation scripts to compare different models and configurations.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/human-pose-estimation.git
   cd human-pose-estimation-master
2. **Install Dependencies:**
   ``pip install -r requirements.txt``
3. **Run The File**
   ``Python app.py``
