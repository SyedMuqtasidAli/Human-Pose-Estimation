# Human-Pose-Estimation
This repository contains code and models for human pose estimation, a computer vision task that involves predicting the positions of human joints (keypoints) in images or videos. The project leverages deep learning techniques to accurately detect and localize keypoints such as shoulders, elbows, knees, and ankles.
